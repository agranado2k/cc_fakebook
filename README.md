# Scenario

Coolpay is a new company that allows to easily send money to friends
through their API.

You work for Fakebook, a successful social network. Youâ€™ve been tasked
to integrate Coolpay inside Fakebook. A/B tests show that users prefer
to receive money than pokes!

You can find Coolpay documentation here:
http://docs.coolpayapi.apiary.io/

You will write a small app that uses Coolplay API in Ruby. The app
should be able do the following:

- Authenticate to Coolpay API
- Add recipients
- Send them money
- Check whether a payment was successful

### How to test
Execute **rake** to run the tests. On the folder **coverage** open the
**index.html** file to take a look in the test coverage.

### Run the aplication
You can run the aplication using **shotgun** server (run **shotgun -p
4567**) or in this link https://ccfakebook.herokuapp.com/.
